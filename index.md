I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My advisor is Prof. Hanghang Tong. Before that, I obtained my M.S degree from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Software (2014-2017) and B.S degree from HuaZhong University of Science and Technology (2010-2014). I transferred from ASU to UIUC in 2019 with my advisor.
